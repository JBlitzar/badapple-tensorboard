<!--Listen so I did this before I started tracking stuff with Hackatime, but I still think it's a fun thing to upload and share with the world. So they require five minutes. I'll write this and perhaps spend some time tiding up the scripts. Although the main deliverable is a non-interactive video anyways, so maybe this doesn't qualify for SOM. We'll see.-->
